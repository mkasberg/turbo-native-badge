A Turbo Native badge for Joe Masilotti!

The STL can be printed in any 3D printing/slicing software, which should also be
able to scale it as desired.

The source (thickness/etc) can be tweaked in `turbo-native-badge.scad` using
[OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/).

The SVG was a prototype that I was planning on importing to SCAD, but it didn't
turn out to be necessary!
